## Real-Time Data Interaction with sockets
This project is a demonstration of real-time data interaction on iOS using Socket.io. 

The app connects to a Socket.io server at `wss://waxpeer.com/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket` to receive updates in real-time.

The main task is to handle data streams in real-time and update the user interface upon receiving "new", "removed", and "update" events.
